This file has information specific to the i386 kgdb option.  Other
platforms with the kgdb option may behave in a similar fashion.

New features: 
============
20020801.1129.03
This is currently the version for the 2.4.18 (and beyond?) kernel.

We have several new "features" beginning with this version:
 
1.) Kgdb now syncs the "other" cpus with a cross cpu NMI.  No more
    waiting and it will pull that guy out of an irq off spin lock :)

2.) We doctored up the code that tells where a task is waiting and
    included it so that the "info thread" command will show a bit more
    than "schedule()".  Try it...

3.) Added the ability to call a function from gdb.  All the standard gdb
    issues apply, i.e. if you hit a break point in the function you are
    not allowed to call another (gdb limitation, not kgdb).  T0 help
    this capability we added a memory allocation function.  Gdb does not
    return this memory (it is used for stings you pass to that function
    you are calling from gdb) so we fixed up a way to allow you to
    manually return the memory (see below).

4.) Kgdb time stamps (kgdb_ts()) are enhanced to expand what was the
    interrupt flag to now also include the preemption count and the
    "in_interrupt" info.  The flag is now called "with_pif" to indicate
    the order, preempt_count, in_interrupt, flag.  The preempt_count is
    shifted left by 4 bits so you can read the count in hex by dropping
    the low order digit.  In_interrupt is in bit 1, and the flag is in
    bit 0.

5.) The command: "p kgdb_info" is now expanded and prints something
    like:
(gdb) p kgdb_info
$2 = {used_malloc = 0, called_from = 0xc0107506, entry_tsc = 67468627259, 
  errcode = 0, vector = 3, print_debug_info = 0, hold_on_sstep = 1, 
  cpus_waiting = {{task = 0xc027a000, pid = 32768, hold = 0, 
      regs = 0xc027bf84}, {task = 0x0, pid = 0, hold = 0, regs = 0x0}}}
    
    Things to note here: a.) used_malloc is the amount of memory that
    has been malloc'ed to do calls from gdb.  You can reclaim this
    memory like this: "p kgdb_info.used_malloc=0" Cool, huh?  b.)
    cpus_waiting is now "sized" by the number of cpus you enter at
    configure time in the kgdb configure section.  This is NOT used any
    where else in the system, but it is "nice" here.  c.)  The tasks
    "pid" is now in the structure.  This is the pid you will need to use
    to decode to the thread id to get gdb to look at that thread.
    Remember that the "info thread" command prints a list of threads
    where in it numbers each thread with its reference number followed
    by the threads pid.  Note that the per cpu idle threads actually
    have pids of 0 (yes there is more than one pid 0 in an SMP system).
    To avoid confusion, kgdb numbers these threads with numbers beyond
    the MAX_PID.  That is why you see 32768 above.

6.) A subtle change, we now provide the complete register set for tasks
    that are active on the other cpus.  This allows better trace back on
    those tasks.

    And, lets mention what we could not fix.  Back-trace from all but the
    thread that we trapped will, most likely, have a bogus entry in it.
    The problem is that gdb does not recognize the entry code for
    functions that use "current" near (at all?) the entry.  The compiler
    is putting the "current" decode as the first two instructions of the
    function where gdb expects to find %ebp changing code.  Back trace
    also has trouble with interrupt frames.  I am talking with Daniel
    Jacobowitz about some way to fix this, but don't hold your breath.

20011220.0050.35
Major enhancement with this version is the ability to hold one or more
cpus in an SMP system while allowing the others to continue.  Also, by
default only the current cpu is enabled on single step commands (please
note that gdb issues single step commands at times other than when you
use the si command).
 
Another change is to collect some useful information in
a global structure called "kgdb_info".  You should be able to just:

p kgdb_info

although I have seen cases where the first time this is done gdb just
prints the first member but prints the whole structure if you then enter
CR (carriage return or enter).  This also works:

p *&kgdb_info

Here is a sample:
(gdb) p kgdb_info
$4 = {called_from = 0xc010732c, entry_tsc = 32804123790856, errcode = 0, 
  vector = 3, print_debug_info = 0}

"Called_from" is the return address from the current entry into kgdb.  
Sometimes it is useful to know why you are in kgdb, for example, was 
it an NMI or a real break point?  The simple way to interrogate this 
return address is:

l *0xc010732c

which will print the surrounding few lines of source code.

"Entry_tsc" is the cpu TSC on entry to kgdb (useful to compare to the
kgdb_ts entries).

"errcode" and "vector" are other entry parameters which may be helpful on
some traps.

"print_debug_info" is the internal debugging kgdb print enable flag.  Yes,
you can modify it.

In SMP systems kgdb_info also includes the "cpus_waiting" structure and
"hold_on_step": 

(gdb) p kgdb_info
$7 = {called_from = 0xc0112739, entry_tsc = 1034936624074, errcode = 0, 
  vector = 2, print_debug_info = 0, hold_on_sstep = 1, cpus_waiting = {{
      task = 0x0, hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0xc71b8000, hold = 0, 
      regs = 0xc71b9f70}, {task = 0x0, hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0x0, 
      hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0x0, hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0x0, 
      hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0x0, hold = 0, regs = 0x0}, {task = 0x0, 
      hold = 0, regs = 0x0}}}

"Cpus_waiting" has an entry for each cpu other than the current one that 
has been stopped.  Each entry contains the task_struct address for that
cpu, the address of the regs for that task and a hold flag.  All these
have the proper typing so that, for example:

p *kgdb_info.cpus_waiting[1].regs

will print the registers for cpu 1.

"Hold_on_sstep" is a new feature with this version and comes up set or
true.  What is means is that whenever kgdb is asked to single step all
other cpus are held (i.e. not allowed to execute).  The flag applies to
all but the current cpu and, again, can be changed:

p kgdb_info.hold_on_sstep=0

restores the old behavior of letting all cpus run during single stepping.

Likewise, each cpu has a "hold" flag, which if set, locks that cpu out
of execution.  Note that this has some risk in cases where the cpus need
to communicate with each other.  If kgdb finds no cpu available on exit,
it will push a message thru gdb and stay in kgdb.  Note that it is legal
to hold the current cpu as long as at least one cpu can execute.

20010621.1117.09
This version implements an event queue.  Events are signaled by calling
a function in the kgdb stub and may be examined from gdb.  See EVENTS 
below for details.  This version also tighten up the interrupt and SMP
handling to not allow interrupts on the way to kgdb from a breakpoint 
trap.  It is fine to allow these interrupts for user code, but not
system debugging.

Version
=======

This version of the kgdb package was developed and tested on
kernel version 2.4.16.  It will not install on any earlier kernels.  
It is possible that it will continue to work on later versions
of 2.4 and then versions of 2.5 (I hope).


Debugging Setup
===============

Designate one machine as the "development" machine.  This is the
machine on which you run your compiles and which has your source
code for the kernel.  Designate a second machine as the "target"
machine.  This is the machine that will run your experimental
kernel.

The two machines will be connected together via a serial line out
one or the other of the COM ports of the PC.  You will need a modem
eliminator and the appropriate cables.

Decide on which tty port you want the machines to communicate, then
cable them up back-to-back using the null modem.  COM1 is /dev/ttyS0 and
COM2 is /dev/ttyS1. You should test this connection with the two
machines prior to trying to debug a kernel.  Once you have it working,
on the TARGET machine, enter:

setserial /dev/ttyS0 (or what ever tty you are using)

and record the port and the irq addresses. 

On the DEVELOPMENT machine you need to apply the patch for the kgdb
hooks.  You have probably already done that if you are reading this
file.

On your DEVELOPMENT machine, go to your kernel source directory and do
"make Xconfig" where X is one of "x", "menu", or "".  If you are
configuring in the standard serial driver, it must not be a module.
Either yes or no is ok, but making the serial driver a module means it
will initialize after kgdb has set up the UART interrupt code and may
cause a failure of the control C option discussed below.  The configure
question for the serial driver is under the "Character devices" heading
and is:

"Standard/generic (8250/16550 and compatible UARTs) serial support"

Go down to the kernel debugging menu item and open it up.  Enable the
kernel kgdb stub code by selecting that item.  You can also choose to
turn on the "-ggdb -O1" compile options.  The -ggdb causes the compiler
to put more debug info (like local symbols) in the object file.  On the
i386 -g and -ggdb are the same so this option just reduces to "O1".  The
-O1 reduces the optimization level.  This may be helpful in some cases,
be aware, however, that this may also mask the problem you are looking
for.

The baud rate.  Default is 115200.  What ever you choose be sure that
the host machine is set to the same speed.  I recommend the default.

The port.  This is the I/O address of the serial UART that you should
have gotten using setserial as described above.  The standard com1 port
(3f8) using irq 4 is default .  Com2 is 2f8 which by convention uses irq
3.

The port irq (see above).

Stack overflow test.  This option makes a minor change in the trap,
system call and interrupt code to detect stack overflow and transfer
control to kgdb if it happens.  (Some platforms have this in the base
line code, but the i386 does not.)

You can also configure the system to recognize the boot option
"console=kgdb" which if given will cause all console output during
booting to be put thru gdb as well as other consoles.  This option
requires that gdb and kgdb be connected prior to sending console output
so, if they are not, a breakpoint is executed to force the connection.
This will happen before any kernel output (it is going thru gdb, right),
and will stall the boot until the connection is made.

You can also configure in a patch to SysRq to enable the kGdb SysRq.
This request generates a breakpoint.  Since the serial port irq line is
set up after any serial drivers, it is possible that this command will
work when the control C will not.

Save and exit the Xconfig program.  Then do "make clean" , "make dep"
and "make bzImage" (or whatever target you want to make).  This gets the
kernel compiled with the "-g" option set -- necessary for debugging.

You have just built the kernel on your DEVELOPMENT machine that you
intend to run on your TARGET machine.

To install this new kernel, use the following installation procedure.
Remember, you are on the DEVELOPMENT machine patching the kernel source
for the kernel that you intend to run on the TARGET machine.

Copy this kernel to your target machine using your usual procedures.  I
usually arrange to copy development:
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/boot/bzImage to /vmlinuz on the TARGET machine
via a LAN based NFS access.  That is, I run the cp command on the target
and copy from the development machine via the LAN.  Run Lilo (see "man
lilo" for details on how to set this up) on the new kernel on the target
machine so that it will boot!  Then boot the kernel on the target
machine.

On the DEVELOPMENT machine, create a file called .gdbinit in the
directory /usr/src/linux.  An example .gdbinit file looks like this:

shell echo -e "\003" >/dev/ttyS0
set remotebaud 38400 (or what ever speed you have chosen)
target remote /dev/ttyS0


Change the "echo" and "target" definition so that it specifies the tty
port that you intend to use.  Change the "remotebaud" definition to
match the data rate that you are going to use for the com line.

You are now ready to try it out.

Boot your target machine with "kgdb" in the boot command i.e. something
like:

lilo> test kgdb

or if you also want console output thru gdb:

lilo> test kgdb console=kgdb

You should see the lilo message saying it has loaded the kernel and then
all output stops.  The kgdb stub is trying to connect with gdb.  Start
gdb something like this:


On your DEVELOPMENT machine, cd /usr/src/linux and enter "gdb vmlinux".
When gdb gets the symbols loaded it will read your .gdbinit file and, if
everything is working correctly, you should see gdb print out a few
lines indicating that a breakpoint has been taken.  It will actually
show a line of code in the target kernel inside the kgdb activation
code.

The gdb interaction should look something like this:

    linux-dev:/usr/src/linux# gdb vmlinux
    GDB is free software and you are welcome to distribute copies of it
     under certain conditions; type "show copying" to see the conditions.
    There is absolutely no warranty for GDB; type "show warranty" for details.
    GDB 4.15.1 (i486-slackware-linux), 
    Copyright 1995 Free Software Foundation, Inc...
    breakpoint () at i386-stub.c:750
    750     }
    (gdb) 

You can now use whatever gdb commands you like to set breakpoints.
Enter "continue" to start your target machine executing again.  At this
point the target system will run at full speed until it encounters
your breakpoint or gets a segment violation in the kernel, or whatever.

If you have the kgdb console enabled when you continue, gdb will print
out all the console messages.

The above example caused a breakpoint relatively early in the boot
process.  For the i386 kgdb it is possible to code a break instruction
as the first C-language point in init/main.c, i.e. as the first instruction
in start_kernel().  This could be done as follows:

#include <asm/kgdb.h>
	 breakpoint();

This breakpoint() is really a function that sets up the breakpoint and
single-step hardware trap cells and then executes a breakpoint.  Any
early hard coded breakpoint will need to use this function.  Once the
trap cells are set up they need not be set again, but doing it again
does not hurt anything, so you don't need to be concerned about which
breakpoint is hit first.  Once the trap cells are set up (and the kernel
sets them up in due course even if breakpoint() is never called) the
macro:

BREAKPOINT;

will generate an inline breakpoint.  This may be more useful as it stops
the processor at the instruction instead of in a function a step removed
from the location of interest.  In either case <asm/kgdb.h> must be
included to define both breakpoint() and BREAKPOINT.

Triggering kgdbstub at other times
==================================

Often you don't need to enter the debugger until much later in the boot
or even after the machine has been running for some time.  Once the
kernel is booted and interrupts are on, you can force the system to
enter the debugger by sending a control C to the debug port. This is
what the first line of the recommended .gdbinit file does.  This allows
you to start gdb any time after the system is up as well as when the
system is already at a break point.  (In the case where the system is
already at a break point the control C is not needed, however, it will
be ignored by the target so no harm is done.  Also note the the echo
command assumes that the port speed is already set.  This will be true
once gdb has connected, but it is best to set the port speed before you
run gdb.)

Another simple way to do this is to put the following file in you ~/bin
directory:

#!/bin/bash
echo  -e "\003"  > /dev/ttyS0 

Here, the ttyS0 should be replaced with what ever port you are using.
The "\003" is control-C.  Once you are connected with gdb, you can enter
control-C at the command prompt.

An alternative way to get control to the debugger is to enable the kGdb
SysRq command.  Then you would enter Alt-SysRq-g (all three keys at the
same time, but push them down in the order given).  To refresh your
memory of the available SysRq commands try Alt-SysRq-=.  Actually any
undefined command could replace the "=", but I like to KNOW that what I
am pushing will never be defined.
 
Debugging hints
===============

You can break into the target machine at any time from the development
machine by typing ^C (see above paragraph).  If the target machine has
interrupts enabled this will stop it in the kernel and enter the
debugger.

There is unfortunately no way of breaking into the kernel if it is
in a loop with interrupts disabled, so if this happens to you then
you need to place exploratory breakpoints or printk's into the kernel
to find out where it is looping.  The exploratory breakpoints can be
entered either thru gdb or hard coded into the source.  This is very
handy if you do something like:

if (<it hurts>) BREAKPOINT;


There is a copy of an e-mail in the Documentation/i386/kgdb/ directory
(debug-nmi.txt) which describes how to create an NMI on an ISA bus
machine using a paper clip.  I have a sophisticated version of this made
by wiring a push button switch into a PC104/ISA bus adapter card.  The
adapter card nicely furnishes wire wrap pins for all the ISA bus
signals.

When you are done debugging the kernel on the target machine it is a
good idea to leave it in a running state.  This makes reboots faster,
bypassing the fsck.  So do a gdb "continue" as the last gdb command if
this is possible.  To terminate gdb itself on the development machine
and leave the target machine running, first clear all breakpoints and
continue, then type ^Z to suspend gdb and then kill it with "kill %1" or
something similar.

If gdbstub Does Not Work
========================

If it doesn't work, you will have to troubleshoot it.  Do the easy
things first like double checking your cabling and data rates.  You
might try some non-kernel based programs to see if the back-to-back
connection works properly.  Just something simple like cat /etc/hosts
>/dev/ttyS0 on one machine and cat /dev/ttyS0 on the other will tell you
if you can send data from one machine to the other.  Make sure it works
in both directions.  There is no point in tearing out your hair in the
kernel if the line doesn't work.

All of the real action takes place in the file
/usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/kgdb_stub.c.  That is the code on the target
machine that interacts with gdb on the development machine.  In gdb you can
turn on a debug switch with the following command:

	set remotedebug

This will print out the protocol messages that gdb is exchanging with
the target machine.

Another place to look is /usr/src/arch/i386/lib/kgdb_serial.c This is
the code that talks to the serial port on the target side.  There might
be a problem there.  In particular there is a section of this code that
tests the UART which will tell you what UART you have if you define
"PRNT" (just remove "_off" from the #define PRNT_off).  To view this
report you will need to boot the system without any beakpoints.  This
allows the kernel to run to the point where it calls kgdb to set up
interrupts.  At this time kgdb will test the UART and print out the type
it finds.  (You need to wait so that the printks are actually being
printed.  Early in the boot they are cached, waiting for the console to
be enabled.  Also, if kgdb is entered thru a breakpoint it is possible
to cause a dead lock by calling printk when the console is locked.  The
stub, thus avoids doing printks from break points especially in the
serial code.)  At this time, if the UART fails to do the expected thing,
kgdb will print out (using printk) information on what failed.  (These
messages will be buried in all the other boot up messages.  Look for
lines that start with "gdb_hook_interrupt:".  You may want to use dmesg
once the system is up to view the log.  If this fails or if you still
don't connect, review your answers for the port address.  Use:

setserial /dev/ttyS0 

to get the current port and irq information.  This command will also
tell you what the system found for the UART type. The stub recognizes
the following UART types:

16450, 16550, and 16550A

If you are really desperate you can use printk debugging in the
kgdbstub code in the target kernel until you get it working.  In particular,
there is a global variable in /usr/src/linux/arch/i386/kernel/kgdb_stub.c
named "remote_debug".  Compile your kernel with this set to 1, rather
than 0 and the debug stub will print out lots of stuff as it does
what it does.  Likewise there are debug printks in the kgdb_serial.c
code that can be turned on with simple changes in the macro defines.


Debugging Loadable Modules
==========================

This technique comes courtesy of Edouard Parmelan
<Edouard.Parmelan@quadratec.fr>

When you run gdb, enter the command

source gdbinit-modules

This will read in a file of gdb macros that was installed in your
kernel source directory when kgdb was installed.  This file implements
the following commands:

mod-list
    Lists the loaded modules in the form <module-address> <module-name>

mod-print-symbols <module-address>
    Prints all the symbols in the indicated module.

mod-add-symbols <module-address> <object-file-path-name>
    Loads the symbols from the object file and associates them
    with the indicated module.

After you have loaded the module that you want to debug, use the command
mod-list to find the <module-address> of your module.  Then use that
address in the mod-add-symbols command to load your module's symbols.
From that point onward you can debug your module as if it were a part
of the kernel.

The file gdbinit-modules also contains a command named mod-add-lis as
an example of how to construct a command of your own to load your
favorite module.  The idea is to "can" the pathname of the module
in the command so you don't have to type so much.

Threads
=======

Each process in a target machine is seen as a gdb thread. gdb thread
related commands (info threads, thread n) can be used.

ia-32 hardware breakpoints
==========================

kgdb stub contains support for hardware breakpoints using debugging features
of ia-32(x86) processors. These breakpoints do not need code modification.
They use debugging registers. 4 hardware breakpoints are available in ia-32
processors.

Each hardware breakpoint can be of one of the following three types.

1. Execution breakpoint - An Execution breakpoint is triggered when code
	at the breakpoint address is executed.

	As limited number of hardware breakpoints are available, it is
	advisable to use software breakpoints ( break command ) instead
	of execution hardware breakpoints, unless modification of code
	is to be avoided.

2. Write breakpoint - A write breakpoint is triggered when memory
	location at the breakpoint address is written.

	A write or can be placed for data of variable length. Length of
	a write breakpoint indicates length of the datatype to be
	watched. Length is 1 for 1 byte data , 2 for 2 byte data, 3 for
	4 byte data.

3. Access breakpoint - An access breakpoint is triggered when memory
	location at the breakpoint address is either read or written.

	Access breakpoints also have lengths similar to write breakpoints.

IO breakpoints in ia-32 are not supported.

Since gdb stub at present does not use the protocol used by gdb for hardware
breakpoints, hardware breakpoints are accessed through gdb macros. gdb macros
for hardware breakpoints are described below.

hwebrk	- Places an execution breakpoint
	hwebrk breakpointno address
hwwbrk	- Places a write breakpoint
	hwwbrk breakpointno length address
hwabrk	- Places an access breakpoint
	hwabrk breakpointno length address
hwrmbrk	- Removes a breakpoint
	hwrmbrk breakpointno
exinfo	- Tells whether a software or hardware breakpoint has occurred.
	Prints number of the hardware breakpoint if a hardware breakpoint has
	occurred.

Arguments required by these commands are as follows
breakpointno	- 0 to 3
length		- 1 to 3
address		- Memory location in hex digits ( without 0x ) e.g c015e9bc

SMP support
==========

When a breakpoint occurs or user issues a break ( Ctrl + C ) to gdb
client, all the processors are forced to enter the debugger. Current
thread corresponds to the thread running on the processor where
breakpoint occurred.  Threads running on other processor(s) appear
similar to other non running threads in the 'info threads' output.  With
in the kgdb stub there is a structure "waiting_cpus" in which kgdb
records the values of "current" and "regs" for each cpu other than the
one that hit the breakpoint.  "current" is a pointer to the task
structure for the task that cpu is running, while "regs" points to the
saved registers for the task.  This structure can be examined with the
gdb "p" command.

ia-32 hardware debugging registers on all processors are set to same
values.  Hence any hardware breakpoints may occur on any processor.

gdb troubleshooting
===================

1. gdb hangs
Kill it. restart gdb. Connect to target machine.

2. gdb cannot connect to target machine (after killing a gdb and
restarting another) If the target machine was not inside debugger when
you killed gdb, gdb cannot connect because the target machine won't
respond.  In this case echo "Ctrl+C"(ASCII 3) in the serial line.
e.g. echo -e "\003" > /dev/ttyS1 This forces that target machine into
debugger after which you can connect.

3. gdb cannot connect even after echoing Ctrl+C into serial line
Try changing serial line settings min to 1 and time to 0
e.g. stty min 1 time 0 < /dev/ttyS1
Try echoing again

check serial line speed and set it to correct value if required
e.g. stty ispeed 115200 ospeed 115200 < /dev/ttyS1

EVENTS
======

Ever want to know the order of things happening?  Which cpu did what and
when?  How did the spinlock get the way it is?  Then events are for
you.  Events are defined by calls to an event collection interface and
saved for later examination.  In this case, kgdb events are saved by a
very fast bit of code in kgdb which is fully SMP and interrupt protected
and they are examined by using gdb to display them.  Kgdb keeps only
the last N events, where N must be a power of two and is defined at
configure time.


Events are signaled to kgdb by calling:

kgdb_ts(data0,data1)

For each call kgdb records each call in an array along with other info.
Here is the array def:

struct kgdb_and_then_struct {
#ifdef CONFIG_SMP
	int	on_cpu;
#endif
	long long at_time;
	int  	from_ln;
	char	* in_src;
	void	*from;
        int     with_if;
	int	data0;
	int	data1;
};

For SMP machines the cpu is recorded, for all machines the TSC is
recorded (gets a time stamp) as well as the line number and source file
the call was made from.  The address of the (from), the "if" (interrupt
flag) and the two data items are also recorded.  The macro kgdb_ts casts
the types to int, so you can put any 32-bit values here.  There is a
configure option to select the number of events you want to keep.  A
nice number might be 128, but you can keep up to 1024 if you want.  The
number must be a power of two.  An "andthen" macro library is provided
for gdb to help you look at these events.  It is also possible to define
a different structure for the event storage and cast the data to this
structure.  For example the following structure is defined in kgdb:

struct kgdb_and_then_struct2 {

If you use this for display, the data elements will be displayed as
pointers to task_struct entries.  You may want to define your own
structure to use in casting.  You should only change the last two items
and you must keep the structure size the same.  Kgdb will handle these
as 32-bit ints, but within that constraint you can define a structure to
cast to any 32-bit quantity.  This need only be available to gdb and is
only used for casting in the display code.

Final Items
===========

I picked up this code from Amit S. Kale and enhanced it.

If you make some really cool modification to this stuff, or if you 
fix a bug, please let me know.
